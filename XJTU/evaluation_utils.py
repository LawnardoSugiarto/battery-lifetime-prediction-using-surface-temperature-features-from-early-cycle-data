"""
This module provides utility functions for evaluating the performance of machine learning models 
and analyzing relationships between variables. It includes functions for calculating error metrics, 
correlation coefficients, and feature importance scores.

Key Functions:
1. root_mean_squared_percentage_error: Computes the root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE) between true and predicted values.
2. error_metrics: Returns a collection of common error metrics, including RMSE, RMSPE, MAE, MAPE, and RÂ² score.
3. correlation_metrics: Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables.
4. rScore: Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient (r-score) for each feature in a dataset.

These functions are primarily used to evaluate model performance, assess feature relevance, and analyze 
relationships between variables in battery cycle life prediction tasks or other regression problems.
