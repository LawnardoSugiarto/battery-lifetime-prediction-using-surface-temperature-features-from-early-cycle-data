Download from the link, unzip, and select the XJTU folder.
Put Batch-1, Batch-2 folders into the "data" folder, for convenient path directory structure.
Each batch folder contains the cells involved in .mat file, containing time-series data recorded during cycling.
Run the convertTo_npy.ipynb to preprocess the .mat files, and batteryDictionary.npy will be generated.
This will be used in the modelTraining_.ipynb files.
Please refer to the pdf in the "data" folder for more information.
