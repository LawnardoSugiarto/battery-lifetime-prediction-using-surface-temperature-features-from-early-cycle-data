Select "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation (2019-01-23)"
Scroll to the bottom and select all three "2017-05-12", "2017-1630", "2018-04-12"
Download the MATLAB Struct File (e.g., 2017-05-12_batchdata_updated_struct_errorcorrect.mat)
Put the three .mat files in the "Data" folder, and run BuildPkl_BatchX.ipynb, where X=1,2,3
Three pickle files will be generated in total from all three .ipynb files, which will be used in the modelTraining_.ipynb files
